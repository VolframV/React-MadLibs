                             he was also a bit {this.props.syn1}. However having a lot of 
                             {this.props.noun2} and {this.props.noun3} 
                             never stoped him from being a little 
                             {this.props.syn2} and maybe just maybe at times a bit
                              {this.props.syn3}. Ofcourse as one might imagine
                               {this.props.noun1} never trully stopped him but instead made his
                                {this.props.syn3} behaviour even stronger!  </p>
